{0,1,2#1,2#2,2} got 3 nodes,2 spearating mark is#ã€‚
clone a undirectedgraph,each node in the graph contains one label and a neighbors
list,
first node label is 0 ,and edges from 0 to node 1 and node2
second node label is 1,and edges from 1 to node 2
third node labels is 2,and edges from 2 to node 2(itself)
